* Chapter 1: Basic Device Configuration
** 1.1 Configure a switch with initial settings
*** 1.1.1 Switch boot sequence
Before a switch is configured, it goes through a five-step boot
sequence

1. loads a power-on self-test (POST) program stored in ROM
2. loads the boot loader software
3. boot loader performs low-leve CPU initialization. It initializes
   the CPU registers which control where physical memory is mapped,
   the quantity of the memory, and its speed
4. the boot loader initializes the flash file system on the system board
5. the boot loader locates and loads a default IOS operating system
   software image into memory and gives control of the switch over to
   the IOS

*** 1.1.2 The boot system command
An environment variable (BOOT) is used by the switches to
automatically boot to a specific IOS. If it is not set, the switch
attempts to load and execute the first executatble file it can find.

Admins can use the command ~show boot~ to shut which IOS is currently
running. To boot a different IOS to the switch use the command:

#+NAME: BOOT COMMAND
#+BEGIN_SRC
S1(config)# boot system flash:/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE.bin
#+END_SRC

*** 1.1.3 Switch LED Indicators
1. SYST
   - shows whether the system is receiving power and is functioning properly
   - OFF: system is off
   - GREEN: system is operating normally
   - AMBER: system is receiving power but is not functioning properly
2. RPS
   - redundant power supply system
   - OFF: RPS is off and/or not properly connected
   - GREEN: connected and ready to provide backup power
   - BLINKING GREEN: RPS is connected but is unavailable because of
     providing power to other device
   - AMBER: RPS is in standby mode or in a fault condition
   - BLINKING AMBER: internal power supply in the switch has failed,
     RPS is providing power
3. STAT
   - Port status LED
   - when whathever GREEN: port status mode is delected (this is the
     default mode)
   - OFF: no link or the port is administratively shutdown
   - GREEN: link is present
   - BLINKING GREEN: there is activity and the port is sending or
     receiving data
   - ALTERNATING GREEN-AMBER: there is a link fault
   - AMBER: the port is blocked to ensure that a loop does not exist
     in the forwarding domain
   - BLINKING AMBER: port is blocked to prevent a possible loop in the
     forwarding domain
4. DUPLX
   - whenever green: duplex mode is selected
   - OFF: half-duplex mode
   - GREEN: full-duplex mode
5. SPEED
   - indicates that the  port speed mode is selected
   - OFF: port operating at 10Mbps
   - GREEN: port operating at 100Mbps
   - BLINKING GREEN: port operating at 1000Mbps
6. PoE
   - Power over ethernet
   - OFF: PoE mode is not selected
   - BLINKING AMBER: PoE mode not selected but at least 1 port has
     denied power or placed in a fault condition
   - GREEN: PoE is on
   - GREEN-AMBER: denied power because the switch power capacity will
     be exceeded by the port
