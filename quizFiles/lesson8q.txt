A: zone ID or scope ID

Q: used by the os to associate the LLA with a specific interface
A: zone ID or scope ID

Q: (t/f) IPv6 GUA can be assigned dynamically using stateless and not stateful services
A: f

Q: No device is tracking the assignment of IPv6 addresses
A: stateless

Q: A DHCPv6 server is managing the assignment of IPv6 addresses
A: stateful

Q: router sends RA messages providing all IPv6 addressing information (network prefix, prefix-length, and default gateway information)
A: SLAAC only or slaac only

Q: Hosts use the RA information exclusively for all their addressing including creating their own GUA
A: SLAAC only or slaac only

Q: Router RA messages provide IPv6 configuration information to hostsand inform them to contact a stateless DHCPv6 server for additional configuration information
A: SLAAC with DHCP server or stateless DHCPv6

Q: Router RA messages inform hosts to contact a stateful DHCPv6 server or DHCPv6 enabled router for all IPv6 configuration information, except the default gateway address
A: DHCPv6 server or stateful DHCPv6

Q: Hosts contact a DHCPv6 server to acquire all of their IPv6 addressing information
A: DHCPv6 server or stateful DHCPv6

Q: Host obtains default gateway information from router RA messages
A: DHCPv6 server or stateful DHCPv6

Q: what are the 3 RA flags
A: A flag, O flag, and M flag

Q: used by a host to identify the dynamic options available to a host
A: RA message flags

Q: The A flag stands for the _____ flag
A: address autoconfiguration

Q: this flag says to use SLAAC to create an IPv6 GUA
A: A flag

Q: the O flag stands for _____ flag
A: other configuration

Q: flag that says other information is available from a stateless DHCPv6 server
A: O flag

Q: The M flag stands for _____ flag
A: managed address configuration

Q: this flag says to use a stateful DHCPv6 server to obtain an IPv6 GUA
A: M flag

Q: Which address type is automatically created by default on a host interface when no RAs are received?
A: link-local address

# 8.2 SLAAC Overview
Q: allows hosts to created their own uniwue IPv6 global unicas taddress without the services of a DHCPv6 server
A: SLAAC

Q: (t/f)SLAAC is a stateless service. This means there is no server that maintains network address information to know which IPv6 addresses are being used and which ones are available.
A: t

Q: SLAAC uses ____ messages to provide addressing and other configuration information that would normally be provided by as DHCP server
A: ICMPv6 RA

Q: command to enable IPv6 routing
A: ipv6 unicast-routing

Q: what flag does the command ipv6 unicast-routing enable?
A: A flag

Q: what IPv6 dynamic addressing method is enabled when the command 'ipv6 unicast-routing' is entered?
A: SLAAC only

Q: a router sends RA messages every ___ seconds
A: 200

Q: multicast address for routers
A: ff02::2

Q: When a client is configured to obtain its addressing information automatically, it sends an __ message to the IPv6 all-routers multicast address of ff02::2.
A: RS

Q: two methods/process a host uses to generate interface ID
A: randomly generated and EUI-64

Q: The 64-bit interface ID is randomly generated by the client operating system. This is the method now used by Windows 10 hosts.
A: randomly generated

Q: the host creates an interface ID using its 48-bit MAC address. The host inserts the hex value of fffe in the middle of the address, and flips the seventh bit of the interface ID. This changes the value of the second hexadecimal digit of the interface ID. Some operating systems default to the randomly generated interface ID instead of the EUI-64 method, due to privacy concerns. This is because the Ethernet MAC address of the host is used by EUI-64 to create the interface ID.
A: EUI-64

Q: process used by a host to ensure that the IPv6 GUA is unique
A: duplicate address detection or DAD

Q: DAD is implemented using ____
A: ICMPv6

# To perform DAD, the host sends an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
#  message with a specially constructed multicast address, called a
#  solicited-node multicast address. This address duplicates the last
#  24 bits of IPv6 address of the host.

Q: The ____ recommends that DAD is used on all IPv6 unicast addresses regardless of whether it is created using SLAAC only, obtained using stateful DHCPv6, or manually configured.
A: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

Q: What method is used by a host to verify an IPv6 address is unique on the local network before assigning that address to an interface?
A: DAD

Q: Which command must be configured on a router to enable it to join the IPv6 all-routers multicast address ff02::2?
A: ipv6 unicast-routing

# 8.3 DHCPv6
Q:  uses parts of SLAAC to ensure that all the necessary information is supplied to the host.
A: stateless DHCPv6

Q: defined in RFC 3315
A: DHCPv6

Q: Server to client DHCPv6 messages use UDP destination port ___
A: 546

Q: client to server DHCPv6 messages use UDP destination port ___
A: 547

Q: command to enable stateless DHCPv6 on an interface
A: ipv6 nd other-config-flag

Q: command that sets O flag to 1
A: ipv6 nd other-config-flag

Q: This option is most similar to DHCPv4. In this case, the RA message tells the client to obtain all addressing information from a ________, except the default gateway address which is the source IPv6 link-local address of the RA.
A: stateful DHCPv6 server

Q: Command to enable stateful DHCPv6 on an interface
A: ipv6 nd managed-config-flag

Q: another command to set the A flag to 0
A: ipv6 nd default no-autoconfig

Q: What DHCPv6 message does a host send to look for a DHCPv6 server?
A: SOLICIT

Q: What DHCPv6 message does a host send to the DHCPv6 server if it is using stateful DHCPv6?
A: REQUEST

Q: What destination UDP port do DHCPv6 clients use to send DHCPv6 messages?
A: 547

# 8.4
Q: command to create a DHCPv6 pool
A: ipv6 dhcp pool POOL-NAME
