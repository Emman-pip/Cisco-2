# Lesson 7: DHCPv4
Q: Steps to obtain a lease
A: DORA

Q: The client starts the process using a broadcast ______ message with its own MAC address to discover available DHCPv4 servers. Because the client has no valid IPv4 information at bootup, it uses Layer 2 and Layer 3 broadcast addresses to communicate with the server. The purpose of the ______ message is to find DHCPv4 servers on the network.
A: DHCPDISCOVER

Q: When the DHCPv4 server receives a DHCPDISCOVER message, it reserves an available IPv4 address to lease to the client. The server also creates an ARP entry consisting of the MAC address of the requesting client and the leased IPv4 address of the client. The DHCPv4 server sends the binding ______ message to the requesting client. step 2 of the DHCPv4 process is a ______ unicast message sent from the DHCPv4 server to the DHCPv4 client that says, in essence, I am a DHCPv4 server, here is an address offer
A: DHCPOFFER

Q: When the client receives the DHCPOFFER from the server, it sends back a _____ message. This message is used for both lease origination and lease renewal. When used for lease origination, the _____ serves as a binding acceptance notice to the selected server for the parameters it has offered and an implicit decline to any other servers that may have provided the client a binding offer.
A: DHCPREQUEST

Q: On receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the server may verify the lease information with an ICMP ping to that address to ensure it is not being used already, it will create a new ARP entry for the client lease, and reply with a _____ message.
A: DHCPACK

Q: (t/f)The DHCPACK message is a duplicate of the DHCPOFFER, except for a change in the message type field.
A: t

Q: Two step process of renewing a lease
A: DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK

Q: Which DHCPv4 messages are sent by the server in the lease obtaining process?

Q: Which DHCPv4 messages are used in the lease renewal process?
A: DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK
