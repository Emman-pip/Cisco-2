Q: This is used to describe the port where a frame enters the device.
A: ingress

Q: This is used to describe the port that frames will use when leaving the device.
A: egress

Q: MAC address table is also known as ____
A: content addressable memory trable or CAM table

Q: is a special type of memory used in high-speed searching applications
A: content addressable memory or CAM

Q: two switching forwading methods
A: store and forward switching, cut-through switching

Q: this method makes a forwarding decision on a frame after it has received the entire frame and checked the frame for errors using a mathematical error-checking mechanism known as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Store-and-forward switching is Ciscoâ€™s primary LAN switching method.
A: store and forward switching

Q: This method begins the forwarding process after the destination MAC address of an incoming frame and the egress port have been determined.
A: cut-through switching

Q: is an error checking process that helps to ensure that the frame is free of physical and data-link errors
A: frame check seqence or FCS

Q: is a modified form of cut-through switching in which the switch only starts forwarding the frame.
A: fragment free switching

Q: The network segments that share the same bandwidth between devices are known as
A: collision domains

Q: A collection of interconnected switches forms a single ____
A: broadcast domain

Q: The Layer 2 broadcast domain is referred to as the _______________
A: MAC broadcast domain
