#: Lesson 4: Inter-VLAN routing

Q: Each router interface was connected to a switch port in different VLANs. The router interfaces served as the default gateways to the local hosts on the VLAN subnet.
A: legacy inter-vlan routing

Q: overcomes the limitation of the legacy inter-VLAN routing method. It only requires one physical Ethernet interface to route traffic between multiple VLANs on a network.
A: router on a stick

Q:  The router-on-a-stick method of inter-VLAN routing does not scale beyond __ VLANs
A: 50

Q: The modern method of performing inter-VLAN routing is to use ______ switches and switched virtual interfaces (SVI)
A: layer 3 switches

Q: A subinterface is created using the __________ global configuration mode command.
A: interface interface_id.subinterface_id

Q: this command configures the subinterface to respond to 802.1Q encapsulated traffic from the specified vlan-id. The native keyword option is only appended to set the native VLAN to something other than VLAN 1.
A: encapsulation dot1q vlan_id [native]

Q: command to see trunk status
A: show interfaces trunks

Q: ______ use hardware-based switching to achieve higher-packet processing rates than routers. ______ are also commonly implemented in enterprise distribution layer wiring closets.
A: layer 3 switches

Q:  global configuration command to allow traffic to be exchanged between different VLANs
A: ip routing
