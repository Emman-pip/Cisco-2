\section{Chapter 1: Basic Device Configuration}
\label{sec:orgbb265a6}
\subsection{1.1 Configure a switch with initial settings}
\label{sec:orgd63feea}
\subsubsection{1.1.1 Switch boot sequence}
\label{sec:orga8e8142}
Before a switch is configured, it goes through a five-step boot
sequence

\begin{enumerate}
\item loads a power-on self-test (POST) program stored in ROM
\item loads the boot loader software
\item boot loader performs low-level CPU initialization. It initializes
the CPU registers which control where physical memory is mapped,
the quantity of the memory, and its speed
\item the boot loader initializes the flash file system on the system board
\item the boot loader locates and loads a default IOS operating system
software image into memory and gives control of the switch over to
the IOS
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{1.1.2 The boot system command}
\label{sec:orgabd0397}
An environment variable (BOOT) is used by the switches to
automatically boot to a specific IOS. If it is not set, the switch
attempts to load and execute the first executatble file it can find.

Admins can use the command \texttt{show boot} to shut which IOS is currently
running. To boot a different IOS to the switch use the command:

\begin{verbatim}
S1(config)# boot system flash:/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE.bin
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{1.1.3 Switch LED Indicators}
\label{sec:org94e7d7c}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SYST
\begin{itemize}
\item shows whether the system is receiving power and is functioning properly
\item OFF: system is off
\item GREEN: system is operating normally
\item AMBER: system is receiving power but is not functioning properly
\end{itemize}
\item RPS
\begin{itemize}
\item redundant power supply system
\item OFF: RPS is off and/or not properly connected
\item GREEN: connected and ready to provide backup power
\item BLINKING GREEN: RPS is connected but is unavailable because of
providing power to other device
\item AMBER: RPS is in standby mode or in a fault condition
\item BLINKING AMBER: internal power supply in the switch has failed,
RPS is providing power
\end{itemize}
\item STAT
\begin{itemize}
\item Port status LED
\item when whathever GREEN: port status mode is delected (this is the
default mode)
\item OFF: no link or the port is administratively shutdown
\item GREEN: link is present
\item BLINKING GREEN: there is activity and the port is sending or
receiving data
\item ALTERNATING GREEN-AMBER: there is a link fault
\item AMBER: the port is blocked to ensure that a loop does not exist
in the forwarding domain
\item BLINKING AMBER: port is blocked to prevent a possible loop in the
forwarding domain
\end{itemize}
\item DUPLX
\begin{itemize}
\item whenever green: duplex mode is selected
\item OFF: half-duplex mode
\item GREEN: full-duplex mode
\end{itemize}
\item SPEED
\begin{itemize}
\item indicates that the  port speed mode is selected
\item OFF: port operating at 10Mbps
\item GREEN: port operating at 100Mbps
\item BLINKING GREEN: port operating at 1000Mbps
\end{itemize}
\item PoE
\begin{itemize}
\item Power over ethernet
\item OFF: PoE mode is not selected
\item BLINKING AMBER: PoE mode not selected but at least 1 port has
denied power or placed in a fault condition
\item GREEN: PoE is on
\item GREEN-AMBER: denied power because the switch power capacity will
be exceeded by the port
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
