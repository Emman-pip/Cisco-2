* WLAN
Configuring home routers are not that scalable and error-prone. They
must be configured manually. *SOLUTION* is to use a *WLC* or Wireless
LAN Controller.

Autonomous access point
- individual


Controller based AP
- centralized config
- monitored by a WLC

  
* WLC
- controls the APs (authentication and configuration)
- controls functions such as SSH, default gateway, 
- is configured with a static IP
- the APs under this will have DHCP addresses
- WLC to SW is a trunk link, *AP to SW is a trunk*

* DEMONSTRATION  
#+NAME: DEMO
#+BEGIN_SRC 
- GAGAMITIN AY 2504 (WLC)
config > Management, change address, subnet mask, DNS server, and default gateway 
server > services > DHCP > fill information > add *WLC address* from past line ^^^
lagay ng same network address yong pc -> web browser -> type the ip address of WLC -> create account -> fill up necessary
  SYSTEM-NAME
  management IP address (address ng WLC)
  subnet mask
  defualt gateway
  
* WAG!! -> management vlan ID should stay at 0
NEXT
  initial network name

after submitting the information, change the PC's VLAN to the WLC VLAN
 make https://ip address of WLC
  
  goto:
  CONTROLLER > interfaced (side) > portnumber [based sa kung saan nakaconnect WLC] (photo sa phone)

  GOTO:
  WLANs > AP Groups
    AP Groups is for organizational purposes
    create group, then ...
    WLANs > enter a wifi name
    APs  > add APs

  ^^^^ Ginagawa nito ay filter yung nibbroadcast na WLANs
  

  

  WLANs > WLANS
    create new, go
    profile name
    ssid
    ID (kung pang ilang wifi number, incremental is ideal)
    
  status - enabled

  interface/interface group - select group

  Security -  WAG KALIMUTAN FLEX VLAN

  *BY DEFAULT*: ibbroadcast lahat ng configured na WLANs!
