* SLAAC and DHCPv6
*EUI-64*
** IPv6 GUA Assignment
#+NAME: IPv6 component
  | x:x:x:     | x:     | x:x:x:x:     |
  |------------+--------+--------------|
  | prefix     | subnet | interface ID |
  | network ID |        |              |

#+NAME: IPv6 public and private
| ipv4            | ipv6                | start in IPv6 |
|-----------------+---------------------+---------------|
| public in ipv4  | global unicast(GUA) | 2/3 - xxx     |
| private in IPv4 | link-local(LLA)     | fe80          |

A computer can only have 1 or 2 IPv6 address, LLA is always
present. GUA is dependent on the network setup.


*** How is IPv6 added to a router interface
On a router, it is manually configured ~ipv6 addresshere/prefix~



*** How is it cconfigured in end devices
Also possible > configure manually on settings (windows)


*** IPv6 Host Link-Local Address
#+GUA vs LLA
| type | obtainable by                      |                                                  |
|------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| GUA  | manually, automatic (DHCPv6/SLAAC) | needs configuration                              |
| LLA  | automatically                      | automatically created when the devices is booted |



*** Router Advertisement
Router advertises the *network ID* to other devices (broadcast). After
it is received by a host, the host will be able to create a *LLA*,
same with GUA (*through MAC address and the network ID*).

/NOTE:/ The addresses are not stored in the router


*** Dynamic GUA Assignment
| Stateless (SLAAC - Stateless address auto configuration)        | Stateful                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| no bindings (no device tracking the assignment of IPv5 address) | can be tracked                                        |
|                                                                 | a server is managing the assignment of IPv6 addresses |

| SLAAC                  | router sends RA messaging all IPv6 addressig information              |
|                        | host uses tha RA information to create IPv6 addressing                |
|                        | *only IP, subnet, and default gateway can be generated*               |
|                        |                                                                       |
| SLAAC with DHCP Server | SLAAC but is able to communicate to the server with is the DNS-server |
|                        |                                                                       |


stateful options
| DHCPv6 Server                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| RA sends instructions to find a DHCPv6 Server |
| default gateway is inside RA                  |



*** Three RA Message Flags
Inside RA, there are flags that will instruct how will the IPv6
address will be obtained/generated
- A
  - adress autoconfiguration flag
  - SLAAC and SLAAC with DHCP
- O
  - other configuration flag
  - SLAAC with DHCP
- M
  - Managed address flag
  - stateful

** SLAAC
Not every network has access ot a DHCPv6 server, but every device in
an IPv6 network needs a GUA.


- It is a stateless service which means no server that maintains
  address information to know which IPv6 addresses ar  being use and
  which ones are availble
- sends periodic RA messages every 200 seconds
- A host can also send a *Router Solicitation (RS)* messages
  requesting an RA
*** Enabling SLAAC
set a ipv6 address and ~ipv6 unicast-routing~, after that it will send
an RA every 20 seconds.


Can have 3 different addresses:
- Link-local
- GUA
- all node address
*** Duplicate Address Detection
DAD - Duplicate Address Detection
- device sends a NS (Neigbor Solicitation), address non ay address
  nya. If may magreply, then may *DUPLICATE*. 

** DHCPv6
STATEFUL DHCP does not require SLAAC

*** SARR
- Solicit to add DHCPv6 servers (DHCPv6 SOLICIT)
- Advertise Unicast (DHCPv6 ADVERTISE)
- Request or Information Request Unicast (DHCPv6 REQUEST for stateful
  and INFORMATION-REQUEST for stateless)
- Reply Unicast (DHCPv6 REPLY)

*** Stateless DHCPv6
#+NAME: Flags
| A | O | M |
|---+---+---|
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
- host uses information on the RA to get the IP, subnet, and default
  gateway. Then it would ask the server for the additional information

- to configure this enter the
  ~ipv6 nd other-config-flag~ (enables the O flag)
  command

- to disable
  ~no ipv6 nd other-config-flag~ (disables the O flag)

  
*** Stateful DHCPv6 Operation
#+NAME: Flags
| A | O | M |
|---+---+---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
- to configure this enter the
  ~ipv6 nd managed-config-flag~ (enables the M flag)
  command
- if naka on yung O flag and M flag, mali config... (di gagana)


/NOTE:/ Other configurations does not work

** Configure DHCPv6 Server
*** Stateless
#+NAME: 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
ipv6 unicast routing
ipv6 dhcp pool POOL-NAME
ipv6 autoconfig
ipv6 dhcp server POOL-NAME interface command
---> other config flag
ipv6 dhcp interface g0/0/1
#+END_SRC
*** Stateful
#+NAME: 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
ipv6 unicast routing

#+END_SRC
*** Configure a DHCPv6 Relay Agent
~ipv6 dhcp relay destination ADDRESS EXIT_INTERFACE~
