*** Spanning Tree Protocol
Is a *loop-prevention network protocol* that allows for redundancy
while creating a loop-free Layer 2 topology. *IEEE 802.1D* (the
spanning tree protocol) is the original IEEE MAC Bridging standard for
STP


STP *ensures that there is olny one logical path between all
destination on the network by intentionally blocking* redundant paths
that could cause a loop. After blocking, the physical paths still
exist to provide redundancy but these paths are disabled to prevent
the loops from occurring

*** STP Recalculation
The following happens when a link fails
1. pc sends broadcast out onto the network
2. the broadcase is then forwarded around the network
3. a link fails
4. some switch unblocks the previously blocked port for a trunk and
   allows the broadcast traffic to traverse the alternate path around
   the network, permitting communication to continue. If the link
   comes back up, STP reconverges, and the port of S2 is again blocked

*** Issues With Redundanct Switch Links
Although path redundancy eliminates the posibility of a single point
of failure, without proper configuration, Layer 2 loops would
occur. Thus result in MAC address table instability, link saturation,
and high CPU utilization on switches and end devices (network will become
unusable).


Layer 2 does not have protocols that have a mechanism to recognize and
eliminate endlessly looping frames (unlike in layer 3). In layer 3, a
router can use the *TTL (Time to Live)* in every IPv4 packet and the
*hop limit* field in every IPv6 packet as a mechanism of stopping
endless loops.


/Note:/ TTL(IPv4) and Hop Limit(IPv6) are decremented by routers everytime it is
passed around, the packet will be dropped once the fields reaches 0.

*** Layer 2 Loops
Without STP enabled, layer 2 loops can for, causing broadcast,
multicast, and unknown unicast frames to loop endlessly. This could
bring down a network in a matter of seconds. 

*** Broadcast Storm
Broadcast storm
- ia an abnormally high number of broadcasts overwhelming the network
  during a specofiv amount of time.
- can be caused by a faulty network interface or a Layer 2 loop in the
  network

*** The Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA)
Based on an algorithm invented by *Radia Perlman* while working for
digital equipment corporation, and was published in the 1985 paper "An
Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an
Extended LAN.


Her STA first selects a root bridge. Then, each switch will determine
a single, least cost path from itself to the root bridge.


STP ensures that there is only one logical path between all
destinations on the network by intentionally blocking redundant paths
that could cause a loop. When a port is blocked, user data is
prevented form entering or leaving that port. Blocking the redundant
paths is critical to preventing loops on the network.


/NOTE:/ STA and STP refer to switches as bridges. This is because in
the early days of Ethernet, switches were referred to as bridges.


**** STP process
1. Select root bridge
2. Block redundant paths


** STP Operations2
*** Steps to a loop free topology
1. elect a root bridge
2. elect the root ports
3. elect designation ports
4. elect alternate (blocked) ports


During STA and STP functions, switches use *Bridge Protocol Data
Units* (BPDUs) to share information about themselves and their
connections. BPDUs are used to elect the root bridge, root ports,
designated ports, and alternate ports. Each BPDU contains a *bridge
ID* (BID) that identidies which switch sent the BPDU. The BID is also
involved in making many of the STA decisions, including root bridge
and port roles.

**** Fields of BID
#+NAME: Fields of BID
|-----------+-----------------+--------------------+-------------|
| component | Bridge priority | extended system id | mac address |
|-----------+-----------------+--------------------+-------------|
| size      | 4 bits          | 12 bits            | 48 bits     |
|-----------+-----------------+--------------------+-------------|

***** Bridge priority
*Default value is the decimal value of 32768.* The range is 0 to 61440
in increments of 4096. A lower bridge priority is preferable. A bridge
priority of 0 takes precedence over all other bridge priorities

***** Extended System ID
Is the decimal value added to the bridge priority value in the BID to
identify the VLAN for this BPDU. This field allows the later
implementations STP, such as Rapid Spanning Tree protocol (RSTP), to
have different root bridges for different sets of VLANs. This can
allow for redundant, nonforwarding links in an STP topology for one
set of VLANs used by different set of VLANs using a different root bridge.


***** MAC Address
When two switches are configured with the same priority and have the
same extenses system ID, the switch having the *MAC address with the
lowest value*, expressed in hexadecimal, will have the lower BID.

**** Four-step process of building a loop-free topology
***** Elect the Root bridge
STA designates a single switch as a root bridgr and uses it as the
reference point for all path calculations. The switches exchange BPDUs
to build the loop-free topology beginning with selecting the root
bridge.


After the election process that determines the root bridge, BPDU
frames will be sent out every two seconds. These frames contain the
BUD of sending switch and the BID of the root bridge, known as the
Root ID.


The switch with the lowest BID will become the root bridge. At first,
all switches declare themselves as the root bridge with their own BID
set as the Root ID. Eventually, the switches learn through the
exchange of BPDUs which switch had the lowest BID and will agree on
one root bridge.

****** Imapct of Default BIDs
It is possible for two or more switches to have the same BID (because
of the default BID 32768). When this happens, the MAC address becomes
the deciding factor as to which switch becomes the root bridge.

/NOTE:/ The priority of switches is 32768 + VLAN ID. Example: 32768 +
1 = 32769

****** Determine the Root Path Cost
After the root bridge has been selectyed, the STA starts the process
of determining the best paths to the root bridge from all destinations
in the broadcast domain. The path information (*root path cost*) is
determined by the sum of all the individual port costs along the path
from the switch to the root bridge.



/NOTE:/ The BPDU includes the root path cost. This is the cost of the
path from the sending switch to the root bridge.


When a switch receives the BPDU, it adds the ingress port cost of the
segment to determine its internal root path cost.

The default port cost are defined by the speed at which the port
operates

| Link speed | STP cose | RTSP cost |
|------------+----------+-----------|
| 10 gbps    |        2 | 2000      |
| 1 gbps     |        4 | 20,000    |
| 100 mbps   |       19 | 200,000   |
| 10 mbps    |      100 | 2,000,000 |


***** Elect Root ports
After the STA algorithm is used to select the *root port*. Every
non-root switch will select *one root port*. The root port is the
*closest to the root bridge* interms of overall cost (best path) to
the root bridge. This overall cost is known as the *internal root path
cost*


The internal root path cost is equal to the sum of all the port costs
along the path to the root bridge. Paths with the lowest cost become
preferred, and all other redundant paths are blocked.


***** Elect Designated Ports
The loop prevention part of spanning tree becomes evident during these
next two steps. After each switch selects a root port, the switches
will then select designated ports.


*Every segment bwtween two switches will have one designated port* The
designated port is a port onthe segment (with two switches) that has
the internal root path cost to the root bridge. */TLDR/*: the designated
port *has the best path to receive traffic leading to the root bridge*


What is not a root port or a designated port becomes an alternate or
blocked port. The end result is a single path from every switch to the
root bridge

/NOTE:/ All switch ports with end devices (hosts) attached are
*designated ports*.

***** Elect Alternate (Blocked) Ports
If a port is not a root port or a designated port, then it becomes an
alternet (or backup) port. Alternate ports and backup ports are in
discarding or blocking state to prevent loops. These ports are in
discarding or blocking state to prevent loops to prevent loops. 

****** Elect a Root Port from Multiple Equal Cost Paths
Root port and designated ports are based on the lowest path cost to
the root bridge. In case those are equal, the switch uses the
following criteria to determine port roles:
1. Lowest sender BID
2. Lowest sender port priority
3. Lowest sender port ID

******* Lowest Sender BID
if equal costs on both paths, then choose the next destination switch
that has a lower bridge ID

******* Lowest Sender Port Priority
lower port priority will have the root port, other will be set as
blocking

******* Lowest Sender Port ID
/NOTE/: The decision is based on the sender's port ID, not the
receiver's port ID

The lower port ID in the sender will have the pairing root port

*** STP PORT STATES
BPDU
- sent for the switches to learn
- every two second it is sent (default) [HELLO TIMER yong every two
  secs]

**** Hello timer
- interval between BPDUs.
- default is 2
- too many will flood the network
- can be between 1 and 10 seconds

**** Forward Delay Timer
*TIme spent in the listening (listening state) and learning (learning
 state)* (can be between 4 and 30 secs)
| states    | time(sec) | BPDU                | MAC address table | forwardin data frames |

**** Max age timer
 the max age is the maximum length of time that a switch waits before
 to change the STP. The default is 20 secs. (can be between 6 and 40 secs)


/NOTE:/ default times can be changed on the root bridge, which
dictated the value of these times for the STP domain


/NOTE:/ STP diameter is the maximum number of switches that data must
cross to connect any two switches. Every time it is increased, timers
will have to be adjusted

*** Per-VLAN Spanning tree (PVST)
Root bridge for each spanning tree instance. The trees overlap.

** Evolution of STP (spanning tree varieties)
The term STP is misleading. Most professionals generally refer to
various implementations of STP such as RSTP(Rapid Spanning Tree
Protocoal) and MSTP(Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol). The IEEE
standards of spanning tree in context is much more accurate to use.


/NOTE/: Original STP is standard *802.1D*

/Class Notes/
- More commonly known as PVST+ in cisco devices (default STP).
- Open standard is RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol)

*** RSTP Concepts
RSTP (IEEE 802.1w) supersedes the original 802.1D while retaining
backwards compatibility. Relatively the same when it comes to
configuration.


RSTP increaded the speed of the recalculation of the spanning tree
whent he Layer 2 network topology changes. It can achieve much faster
convergence in a proprly configured network, somtimes in as little as
a few hundred milliseconds. If a port is configured to be an alternate
port, it can immediately change to a forwarding state without waiting
for the network to converge

/NOTE/: RAPID PVST+ is the cisco implementation of RSTP on a per-VLAN
bases. WIth it, an independent instance of RSTP runs for each VLAN.

*** RSTP Port States and Port Roles
Port roles and states between STP and RSTP are similar

**** STP and RSTP Port States
There are only three port states in TSTP. The 802.1D disabled state,
blocking state, and listening state are merges into a unique 802.1w
*discarding state*

- backup port is for hubs
- alternate port is for switches

*** PortFast And BPDU Guard
When a switch port is set to PortFast, that port can transition form
blocking to forwarding immediately, bypassing the usual 802.1D STP
transition states. 
*** Port fast BPDU
portfast
- implemented on a switch that is connected on a end device
- from disable, punta agad ng forwarding
- optimization lang, di sinasama sa spanning tree yung nasa end-devices
- not applicable sa ibang ports (switch to switch), might lose critical data needed for
  the spanning tree
  
*** BPDU Guard
- security feature of a switch
- when a port is not used, must be set here (for avoiding security bridges)
- when a port in bpdu guard receives a BPDU messages, the port will be 
automatically be turned off

*** Alternatives to STP
- Layer 3!!! (routers)
- Multi System Link Aggregation (MLAG)
- Shortest Path Bridgin
- Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links (TRILL)
