* EtherChannel
Can be used as a connection to an SVI
** Introduction
EtherChannel aggregates links between devices into bundles. It is used
to increase bandwidth, but at the same time a keep a redundant and
loop free network.


There are two protocols, PAgP and LACP

** EtherChannel operation
*Link aggregation* is comonly implemented between access layer and
distribution layer switches to increase the uplink bandwidth. 

*** Link Aggregation
There are scenarios in which more bandwidth or redundancy between
devices is needed than what can be provided by a single link. Multiple
links could be connected between devices to increase
bandwidth. However, STP, which is enable on Layer 2 switches like
Cisco switches by default, will block redundant links to prevent
switching loops.


*Link aggregation technology* allows redundant links between devices
that will not be blocked by STP. This technology is known as
EtherChannel.


*EtherChannel* is a link aggregation technology that groups multiple
physical ethernet links together into one single logical link. It is
used to provide fault tolerance, load sharing, increased bandwidth,
and redundancy between switchjes, routers, and servers


EtherChannel makes it possible to combine the number of physical links
between the switches to increase the overall speed of switch-to-switch
communication.

- bundling channels (links) into one logical link
- called as *link aggregation* in other standards
- used to provide fault tolerance
- physical links can be increased to increase the bandwidth

*** EtherChannel
Was originally developed by Cisco as a LAN switch-to-swtich technique
of grouping several Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet ports into one
logiacl channel. Whenan EhterChannel is configure, the resulting
virtual interfac eis called a *port channel*. The physical interfaces
are bundled together into a port channel interface.

- *port channel* the resulting virtual interface from EtherChannel

*** Advantages of EtherChannel
- most configuration tasks can be done on the etherChannel ports not
  on physical interfaces
- EtherChannel relies on existing switchports, cheap
- loadbalancing takes place on the links bundled
  - load balancing is equally distributing data within the bundled
    links
- STP can still work with EtherChannel
- links inside the port channel might shutdown, but as long as there
  are ones wortking, it will work

*** Implementation restrictions
- interfaces cannot be mixed
- catalyst 2960 can only bundle up to *six* interfaces
- port channel names should be named consistently (configuration of
  native vlan, trunks, etc)
- currently, EtherChannel can consists of up to eight
  compatibly-configured ethernet ports. EtherChannel provides
  full-duplex bandwidth up to 800Mbps (Fast EtherChannel) or 8Gbps
  (Gigabit EtherChannel) between one switch and another switch of host
- individual etherchannel group memeber port configuration must be
  consistent on both devices. If the physical ports of one side are
  configured as trunks, the phycial ports of the other side must also
  be configure as trunks within the sam native VLAN. Additionally, all
  ports in each EtherChannel link must be configured as Layer 2 ports.

  

*** AutoNegotiation Protocols
- EtherChannels can be formed though negotiation using one of two
  protocols: PAgP or LACP
  - PAgP
    - for cisco
    - Port aggregation protocol
      
  - LACP
    - for open standard
    - link aggregation control protocol

      
/NOTE/: It is also possible to configure a static or unconditional
EtherChannel without PAgP or LACP

*** PAgP Operation
Is sa Cisco-proprietary protocol that aids in the automatic creation of
EtherChannel links. When an EtherChannel is configured using PAgP,
PAgP packaets are sent between EtherChannel-capable prots to negotiate
the forming of a channel. When PAgP identifies matched Ethernet links,
it groups the links into an EtherChannel. The EtherChannel is then
added to the spanning tree as a single port.


When enabled, PAgP also manages the EtherChannel. PAgP packets are
sent every *30 seconds*. PAgP checks for configuration consistency and
manages link addtions and failures between two switches. It ensures
that when an EtherChanel is created, all ports have the same type of
configuration.

/NOTE/: In EtherChannel, it is mandatory that all ports have the same
speed, duplex setting, and VLAN information. Any oprt modification
after the creation of the channel also changes all other channel ports


PAgP helps create the EtherChannel link by detecting the configuration
of each side and ensuring that links are compatible so that
EtheChannel link can be enabled when needed. The modes for PAgP are as
follows:
- On
  - This mode forces the interface to channel without PAgP
  - interfaces configures in the on mode do not exchange PAgP packets
- PAgP desirable
  - places an interface in an active negotiating state in which the
    *interface initiates negotiations with other interfaces* by sending
    PAgP packets
- PAgP auto
  - places an interfaces in a passive negotiating state in which the
    interface responds to the PAgP packets that is receives but does
    not initiate PAgP negotiation
*** PAgP Modes
| S1        | S2             | Channel establishment |
|-----------+----------------+-----------------------|
| on        | on             | yes                   |
| on        | desirable/auto | no                    |
| desirable | desirable      | yes                   |
| desitable | auto           | yes                   |
| auto      | auto           | no                    |


/NOTE:/ ON is not under any autonegotiation protocol!!! NOT EVEN IEEE
802.1ad standard


/Class notes/:


When a port is set to PAgP, it will *try to negotiate* with the other
side.


PAgP packets are sent for the port to learn (like in STP)
- MANDATORY TO HAVE
  - SPEED
  - NATIVE VLAN
  - VLAN ASSIGNMENT

    
- ON
  - forces the interface to channel without PAgP
  - does not exchange PAgP packets
  - not counted as PAgP
- PAgP desirable
  - places an interface in an active negotiation state in which the
    interface *initializes*
  - 
- PAgP auto
  - places on interfaces in a passive negotiation
*** PAgP Modes
| mode | match | desc               |
|------+-------+--------------------|
| on   | des   | no channel created |
| on   | auto  | no channel created |
| on   | on    | channel            |
| des  | auto  | channel            |
| des  | des   | channel            |
| auto | auto  | nook               |



*** Configure Guidelines
- etherchannel support
- speed and duplex
- vlan match
- range of vlans (same)

*** LACP Operation
LACP is specified in *IEEE 802.3ad* and allows several physical ports to
be bunmdled to form a single logical channel. LACP allows a switch to
negotiate an automatic bundle by sending LACP packets to the other
switch, much like PAgP. Because it is a standard of IEEE, it can be
used to facilitate EtherChannels in multiventer environments. On Cisco
devices, both protocols are supported


/NOTE/: LACP was originally defined as 802.3ad. However, LACP is now
defined in the newer IEEE 802.1AX standard for local and metropolitan
area networks



It provides the same negotiation benefirs as PAgP. LACP helps create
the EtherChannel link by detecting the configuration of each side and
making sure that they are compatible so that EtherChennel link can be
enable when needed. The modes for LACP are as follows:
- On
  - this mode forces the interface to channel without LACP
  - interfaces configured in the on mode do not exchange LACP packets
- LACP active
  - this LACP mode places a port in an active negotiating state
  - ijn this state, the port initiates negotiations with other ports
    by sending LACP packets
- LACP passive
  - places a port in a passive negotiating state
  - in this state, to port responds to the LACP packets that it
    receives but does not initiate LACP packet negotiation



LACP allows up to eight active links, and also eight standby links. A
standby link will become active should one of current active links
fail

**** LACP modes
| S1      | S2             | Channel Establishment |
|---------+----------------+-----------------------|
| on      | on             | yes                   |
| on      | active/passive | no                    |
| active  | active         | yes                   |
| active  | passive        | yes                   |
| passive | passive        | no                    |


** Configure EtherChannel
*** Configuration Guidelines
- EtherChannel support
  - all ethernet interfaces must support etherchannel with no
    requirement that interfaces by physically continguous
- speed and duplex
  - all interfaces in in a port channel must have the same speed and duplex
- VLAN match
  - all interfaces inhe etherchannel bundle must be assigned to the
    same vlan or be configured as s trunk
- range of VLANs
  - an ether channel suports the same allowed range of VLANs on all
    the interfaces in a trunking etherchannel
  - if the allowed range of VLANs is not the same, the intefaces do
    not form an EtherChannel, even when they are set to auto or
    desirable mode
*** LACP Configuration
**** Steps
1. spaciface the interfaces that compose the EtherChannel using
   ~interface range interface~ global config mode command
2. create a port channer interface with the ~channel group identifier
   mode active~ command in interface range configuration mode. This
   identifier specifies a channel group number. The mode active
   keywords identify the port chanel as an LACp EtherChannel config
3. to change layer 2 setting on the port channel interface, enter port
   channel interface configuration mode using the ~interface
   port-channel~ command, followed by the interface identifier.
