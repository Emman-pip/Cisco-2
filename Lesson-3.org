* VLANs (Week 2)
Are created at the Layer 2 to reduce or eliminate broadcast
traffic. VLANs are how you break up your network into smaller networks
so that the devices and people within a single VLAN are communicating
with each other and not having tof manage traffic from other networks.jj

** Overview of VLANs
*** VLAN Definitions
Provide segmentation and organizational flexibility in a switched
network. A group of devices withina VLAN communicates as if each
device was attached to the same cable. VLANs are based on *logical*
connections instead of physical connections


A VLAN creates a logical broadcast domain that can span multiple
physical LAN segments. VLANs improve network performance by separating
large broadcast domains into smaller ones. If a device in one VLAN
sends a broadcast Ethernet frame, all devices in the VLAN receive the
frame, but devices in other VLANs do not.
*** Benefits of a VLAN Design
Each VLAN in a switched netword corresponds to an IP
network. Therefore, VLAN design must take into consideration the
implementation of hiearchical network addressing scheme. *Hierarchical
network addressing* means that IP network numbers are applied to
network segments or VLANs in a way that takes the network as a whole
into consideration.

*** Types of VLANs
**** Default VLAN
is the VLAN 1 on a cisco switch.


/NOTE/: All port are assigned to VLAN 1 by default. The native VLAN and
management VLAN is VLAN 1. Also, VLAN 1 cannot be renamed or deleted.


The command ~show vlan brief~ outputs the vlans on a switch and the
ports assigned to them.
**** Data VLAN
are VLANs configured to seperate user-generated traffic. Referred to
as *user VLANs* because they seperate the network into groups of users
or devices.

/NOTE/: voice and netowrk management traffic should not be permitted
on data VLANs

**** Native VLAN
User traffic from a  VLAN must be tagged with its VLAN ID when it is
sent to another switch. Trunk ports are used between switches to
support the transmission of tagged traffic. Specifically, an *802.1Q*
trunk port inserts a 5 byte tag in the ethernet frame header to
identify the VLAN to which the frame belongs

Where untagged frames are assigned to

**** Management VLAN
is a data VLAN configured specificalled for network management
traffic, including secure shell (ssh), telnet, HTTPS, HTTP, and
SNMP. By default, VLAN 1 is configured as the management VLAN.



**** Voice VLAN
A seperate VLAN called a voice VLAN is needed to support Vocie over
IP. VoIP traffic requires:
- assured bandwidth to ensure voice quality
- transmission priority over other types of network traffic
- ability to be routed around congested areas on the network
- delay of less than 150 ms across the network


To meet the requirements, the entire network must be designed to
support VoIP.



** VLANs in a Multi-switched Environment

*** Defining VLAN Trunks
trunks allow all VLAN trffic to propagate between switches. It is a
conduit that allows multiple VLANs between switches and routers. 

*** Network Without VLANs
When a switch receives a broadcast frame on one of its ports, it
forwards the frame out all other ports except the port where the
broadcast was received. Meaning, a faulty device could cause network
congestion to the whole switched network.


*** Network with VLANs




*** Vlan Identification with a Tag
Tagging is the process of putting the VLAN information of an ethernet
frame when passing through a trunk. This is accomplished by the IEEE
802.1Q header


The VLAN tag control information field consists of a Type field,
priority field, a canonical format identifier field, and VLAN ID field

| field                             | description                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type                              | tag protocol ID (TPID)                                                              |
|                                   | 2-byte value                                                                        |
|                                   |                                                                                     |
| user priority                     | 3-bit value that supports level or service implementation                           |
|                                   |                                                                                     |
| CFI (canonical format identifier) | 1 bit identifier that enables token ring frames to be carried across ethernet links |
|                                   |                                                                                     |
| VLAN ID (VID)                     | 12-bit VLAN identification number that supports up to 4096 VLAN IDs                 |

After the tag control information fields are inserted, the switch
recalculates the FCS values and inserts the new value into the frame


*** Native VLANs and 802.1Q Tagging
defaults to VLAN 1.

**** Untagged frames on the native VLAN
handled by/forwarded to the native vlan


*** Voice VLAN Tagging
Seperatate VLAN is required. This enables QoS and security policies to
be applied to voice traffice


Cisco IP Phone contains an integrated three-port 10/100 switch. The
ports provide dedicated connections to the following devices:
- Port 1: connects to the switch or other VoIP device
- Port 2: an internal 10/100 interface that carries the IP phone
  traffic
- Port 3: (access port) connects a PC or other device

*** Void Vlan Verification Example
~show interface fa0/18 switchport~ command will output information
about the said switchport


** VLAN Configuration

*** VLAN Ranges on Catalyst Switches
Normal Range
- from 1 to 1005
- used in small- and medium-sized business and enterprise networks
- identified by a VLAN ID between 1 to 1005
- IDs 1002 to 1005 are reserved for legacy network technologies
- configurations are stored int the flash:vlan.dat
- when configured, VLAN trunking protocol (VTP) helps synchronize the
  VLAN database between switches



Extended range
- from 1006 to 4094
- used by service providers
- by a VLAN ID between 1006 and 4094
- configurations are saved, by default, in the running configuration
- the support fewer VLAN features than normal range VLANs
- required VTP transparent mode configuration support extended range VLANs

vlan~ to remove the allowed vlans and remove the native vlan


** Dynamic Trunking Protocol
*** Introduction to DTP
It is a protocol that allows automatic negotiate trunking with a
neigboring device. It is automatically enabled on 2960 and 3650
Catalyst switches. To enable this mode enter the ~switchport mode dynamic auto~ interface configuration command. 
*** Negotiated Interface Modes
~switchport mode { access | dynamic { auto | desirable } | trunk }~


| option            | description                                                                                                      |
|-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| access            | puts the interface into permanent nontrunking mode and negotiates to convert the link into a nontrunk link       |
|                   | the interface becomes a nontrunk interface regardless of whether the neighboring interface is a trunk interface  |
|                   |                                                                                                                  |

* Notes During Class

** [3.0] Overview of a VLAN
*** LAN
- Local area network
- connected devices in a small geographical area
- usually are a switch network (switch is sufficient to intermediate
  all)
- problem is usually the *broadcast domain*
  - a switch only has one broadcast domain, all devices connected to
    the switch will receive the b-message
  - messages can be unintentionally sent, violates the concept of
    confidentiality 

*** VLAN
- logical connections with other similar devices
- idea is splitting the switch into parts for segregation (will split
  the broadcast domain)
- *purpose is to virtually split the switch to several LANs*

**** placing devices into various VLANs have the following
- provides segmentation
- organization
- broadcasts, multicasts, and unicasts are isolated
- VLAN have unique range of IP addressing
- smaller broadcast domains
- improves security
  - user groups on the same vlan
- reduces cost
- better performance
- simpler management

** Types of VLAN
- Default VLAN
  - VLAN 1
  - switches have this by default
  - default: native VLAN, VLAN, Management VLAN, cannot be deleted or
    renamed
  - all ports are here by defaultt

#+NAME: vlan show
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Switch# show vlan brief
#+END_SRC

- Data vlan
  - where users data flow through
- Native VLAN
  - free passes
  - used for trunk links

- Management VLAN
  - for SSH and Telnet VTY    
- Voice VLAN
  - when there is an voIP, a voice VLAN is required
  - 

/VLANS will be changed as best practive/

/one [END] device can only have one vlan/

A cisco (catalysy) switch can have 4096 vlans

** [3.2] VLANs in a multi switched environment
- VLAN trunk
  - allows vlan of the same number (vlan 10) through other switches
  - will allow devices can have the same broadcast domain even if long
    distance
  - Trunk link: allows links between switches' VLANs
  - *a point to point link* between two switches, switch or another
    networking device
  - allows more than one vlan
  - extend vlan over the whole network
  - 802.1Q trunking
  - Vlans cannot communicate without a router (inter VLAN)

    
** VLAN Identification with Tag
- *IEEE 802.1Q*
- used to identify which member of vlan is the frame
*** Basics
- if a message will do throught a trunk, 802.1Q(Tagging) is needed
- if native vlan, then tagging is not required
- both ends of the trunk link must be configured with the same native VLAN
** VLAN in multiple switch environment
*** VoIP VLAN
- middle man, will still work on the end device at the end...
~show interfaces fa0/18 switchport~

- modes of VoiP
- auto
- dynamic auto
- dynamic desirable
- access
- trunk
*** [3.3] VLAN Configuration
- stored in a vlan.dat in flash
- vlan-id can be form vlan 2-1000

  *default mode:* dynamic auto
  *needs to be changed to access*
