* FHRP Concepts (First Hop Redundancy Protocols)

** First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)
Another way to prevent single point of failure. Like STP to Layer 3.

Basically allows multiple default gateways.





*** Router Redundancy
- a redundancy protocol provides the machanism for which router should
  take the *active role* in forwarding traffic. 
*FIRST HOP REDUNDANCY (definition)* 
**** Virtual Routers
- will allow access to different default gateways
- two or more routers can act as a virtual router, thus providing
  alternate routes for default gateways
- also creates a virtual mac address


*** FHRP Options
FHRP is 
| HSRP                           | cisco                                                                       |
| HSRP for IPv6                  |                                                                             |
| VRRPv2                         | non-cisco                                                                   |
| GLBP                           | cisco-proprietary FHRP                                                      |
|                                | protects data traffic from failed router circuit that allows load balancing |
| ICMP Router Discovery Protocol | to look for routers that could be a member of the FHRP                      |


** HSRP
Cisco-proprietary. 

*** HSRP Priority and Preemption
- *default priority is 100* (in routers, changeable)
- if equal, active is the one with higher address
- 

*** HSRP Preemption
- an active router will stay as *active* even if there is a new router
  with higher priority
- to preemp means to, make a router win the election. Without it, the
  active router might change.

  
*** HSRP States and Times
| HSRP State | Desc                                |
|------------+-------------------------------------|
| Initial    | when an interface becomes available |
| learn      | router has not seen a hello message |
| listen     | neither active nor the standby      |
| speak      | sends hello message                 |
| standby    | can be active router anytime        |

*HSRP HELLO TIMER IS 3 secs*


*standby will become active router without HELLO TIMER FOR 10 SECS*


#+NAME: 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
CHANGE PRITORITY OF ACTIVE ROUTER
  int g0/0
  standby priority 150
  standby ip 192.168.10.1

SET A STANDBY
  int g0/0
  standby ip 192.168.10.1

REELECT
  standby preempt

CHECK STATUS
  show standby
#+END_SRC

/NOTE:/ lagi nakabroadcast kasi hindi massave yung nangagaling sa
*physical interface* yung replies. (Massave temporarily but mawaala
din kasi hindi nagrreply yung virtual router)
