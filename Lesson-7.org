* DHCPv4
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

** DHCPv4 Concept
- assigns ip addresses and other network configuration automatically
- extremely useful and time-saving tool for setting addresses in
  end-devices (as they also compose the bulk of most networks)
- a server (standalone) can act as a DHCP server, servers are
  advisable for large networks. 
- if small to medium size network, a router can act as a DHCPv4 server
- DHCP servers assigns, or leases, an IPv4 addresses from a pool of
  addresses for a limited period of time
- clients lease the information from the server for an
  administratively defined priod (set by administrators)
- set time are commonly between 24 hrs to 1 week

** DHCPv4 Operation
A DHCP server works in a client/server mode.
- clients connects to he network with that leased IPv4 until the lease expires
- lease ensures that clients that move or power off do not keep
  addresses that they no longer need
- when a lease expired, DHCP server returns the address to the pool
  where it can be reallocated as necessary

** Steps to Obtain a Lease (DORA)
REMEMBER DORA!
- D (DHCPDISCOVER)
- O (DHCPOFFER)
- R (DHCPREQUEST)
- A (DHCPACK)


All messages FROM DORA are all BROADCASTS.
| server |        | end-device       |
|        | <----  | discover message |
|        | -----> | offer            |
|        | <---   | request          |
|        | ---->  | acknowledgement  |

APIPA(169.254...) if all fails



** Steps to Renew a Lease
Prior to lease expiration, the client begins a two-step process to
*renew* the lease with the DHCPv4 server
1. DHCP Request
2. DHCP Acknowledgement

** Configuration of a Cisco IOS DHCPv4 Server
*** Steps
1. exclude IPv4 addresses. A single address or range of addresses can
   be excluded by specifying the low-address and high-address of the
   range. Excluded addresses should be those addresses that are
   assigned to routers, servers, printers, and other devices that have
   benn or will be manually configured
#+NAME: exclude ip addresses
#+BEGIN_SRC
name(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address low-address [high-address]
name(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address one-address
#+END_SRC

2. Define a DHCPv4 pool name. TO create a pool with specified name and
   puts the router in DHCPv4 configuration mode which is identified by
   the prompt router
#+NAME: poolname
#+BEGIN_SRC 
name(config)# ip dhcp pool-name
#+END_SRC


3. give information to the router, from the DHCP


/common information given by the dhcp ip, subnet, default gateway, dns
server, domain-name/


#+NAME: give info for the protocol
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(dhcp-config)# network ip-address-v4 subnetmask
(dhcp-config)# default-router address
(dhcp-config)# dns-server address [address2, address2, ...]
(dhcp-config)# domain-name cisco.com
#+END_SRC
** Verification
#+NAME: verification
#+BEGIN_SRC 
show run | section dhcp
show ip dhcp binding
show ip dhcp server statistics
#+END_SRC
| command                        | description                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| show run                       | section dhcp displays the dhcpv4 commands configured on the router                                  |
| show ip dhcp binding           | list all IPv4 address to mac address bindings provided by the DHCPv4 service                        |
| show ip dhcp server statistics | displays count information reagarding the number of DHCP4 messages that have been sent and received |


** Verification in End Devices
#+NAME: end device verification
#+BEGIN_SRC 
ipconfig /all
ipconfig /renew
#+END_SRC
** Disable the cisco ios DHCPv4 server
is enabled by default
#+NAME: disable dhcp
#+BEGIN_SRC 
no service dhcp
service dhcp
#+END_SRC

** DHCP relay
To allow discover messages to go over the other broadcast domains
#+NAME: relay
#+BEGIN_SRC 
R1(config)int int-id
R1(config-if)ip helper-address address
R1(config-if)end
#+END_SRC

/NOTE: After paglagpas ng router, magiging unicast yung broadcast/

/NOTE: CAN BE USED (ip helper-address interface config command) IN ROUTER ON
A STICK topology/

** Server as a DHCP server (in server-PT)
Go to *services tab* > *DHCP*

- serverPool set to 0 lahat
- then toggle to on and fill up the needed information
- then set a static IP address

** Router as a DHCP server
- set address to the default gateways
- setup a pool
- set up a dns server
  - on the service
  - add a name (cisco.com)
  - add a ip add (based on requirements)
#+NAME: router	
#+BEGIN_SRC 
enable
conf term
ip dhcp excluded-adderess 192.168.20.1 192.168.20.9l
ip dhcp excluded-adderess 192.168.20.254
ip dhcp pool pool-name
network 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0
default-router 192.168.20.1
dns-server 192.168.20.254
#+END_SRC

** Configure a DHCPv4
*** Cisco Router as a DHCPv4 Client
For ISP and private/public networks.

*** steps
- configure POOL on ISP
#+NAME: pool
#+BEGIN_SRC 
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.10.10.1
ip dhcp pool WAN_POOL
(dhcp-config)# network 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.252 # other information in DHCP is not needed
#+END_SRC

- configure dhcp in the router
#+NAME: r1
#+BEGIN_SRC 
int g0/0
ip address dhcp
no shutdown
#+END_SRC
  
*** Home router
- GUI > dhcp
  - enable (set to Access Point(AP) if access point lang sya)
- if dhcp mode --> sya magbibigay ng IP address
